# Depth Map Generator

## Dependencies
    - Python <= 3.7.9
    - Pip
    - OpenCV
    - PyTorch
    - Intel/MiDaS
    - NumPy
    - timm

## Goals

- My goal with this project is to write a python program that can generate depth map information from an image, a video and a connected camera.

## Further Steps
- I would like to use the frame depth information to generate 3D scenes using point clouds once I learn more about Open3D.

## Purpose

- The purpose of this project was to learn more about OpenCV and PyTorch with the intention of having a complete python program that I could put onto my git repository as an example of my work.

- It was written in a Jupyter Notebook so that anyone could test it anywhere as long as their Python kernel version is less than 3.7.9 since PyTorch has problems with later Python kernels.
